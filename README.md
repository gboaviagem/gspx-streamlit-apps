# gspx-streamlit-apps

Streamlit App(s) to showcase some tools from (and applications with) Quaternion Graph Signal Processing, a framework proposed in my doctorate research and implemented in my `gspx` package.

See **[here](https://github.com/gboaviagem/gspx)** the Python package and **[here](https://github.com/gboaviagem/phd-thesis)** the PhD thesis.

### Apps currently deployed

The source code for each app may be inspected in the `/apps` folder. Deployed versions:

- [Denoising a quaternion graph signal via FIR low-pass filtering](https://gboaviagem-gspx-streamlit-apps-apps03-qlms-streamlit-7aidl4.streamlit.app/): created with the `apps/03-qlms-streamlit.py` script.
